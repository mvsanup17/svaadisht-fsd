                            Our food has to be grown, reared or caught. The food is then processed in different ways. 
                            Finally, the food is sold to the public through a range of different methods, such as farm shops/markets, supermarkets,
                            butchers/delicatessens, online retailers, restaurants and cafes. Some people grow food at home or at allotments.
                            People should be able to identify the different ways in which a range of food is sourced, processed and sold.
